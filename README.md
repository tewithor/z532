# Challenges and Successes 
One of the challenges that the design team faced during the website design process was determining how to restructure the layout of the Craftsmen by Design website. The previous website had several different pages but very little content on those pages, which made the website unnecessarily large and more cumbersome to navigate. Since the primary purpose of the website was to serve as a "show-and-tell" space for the company's services, it needed to be streamlined and easily accessible for potential customers wanting to view and read about the company's services. The design team decided to condense the company's website into a single page, with distinct sections for different services and informational content. By choosing this layout style, the design team created a website that still contains all of the necessary content for the company's target audience, but in a more efficient and accessible format. 

With regards to creating the updated website and writing the necessary code, the designers found that implementing the Google Maps feature was particularly difficult, especially because the website is designed to be mobile-responsive. While implementing the gallery was not particularly challenging, the designers did deliberate extensively over the design and layout of the gallery, since it is a critical part of the website. While the team initially considered having three separate galleries, one for each of the company's major services, the team ultimately decided to stick with one gallery to house all of the company's images. 

Finally, the designers have had difficulty contacting the previous web designer for critical information about the code and server used for the existing website. Because of this, the new website is not yet live. The designers will continue to try and contact the designer and will also explore alternate options for the new website, in the event that the web designer cannot be reached.
